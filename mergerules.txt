# Load sequence unique keys from file
#
# Format of file is lines of:
# <mode> <path to sequence field> <space> <path to key> <space> <path to key> ...
# e.g.
# set *.GameObject.m_Component *.fileID
# Meaning * matches all fileIDs, the matching GameObjects of those and look at the
# m_Components sequence.
# The unique key for an item in that sequence is the fileID of any objects in there.
#
# This would match the YAML:
# 1:
#   GameObject:
#     m_Component: [ { 1: { fileID: 32 } }, { 5: { fileID: 88 }} ]
#
# And use 32 and 88 as unique keys for the item in the m_Components sequence
#
# The lines themselves need to be in [arrays] or [exclusions] sections:
#
# Arrays:
# - indicates that a specified path is to be treated as an array; either as a
#   "set" with a key value, or as "plain" array without key values. Default
#   for all arrays is to do a hybrid and try to match with some known heuristics.
# - <mode> is one of "set" or "plain".
#
# Exclusions:
# - "exclude" indicates which paths should not be attempted to merge; if both sides
#   have modified it then it is to be treated as a conflict.
# - <mode> is one of "include", "exclude", "includeIfContains", "excludeIfContains".
#
# Comparisons:
# - "float" <float value to compare> <relative comparison value>
#	OR
# - "float" <float value to compare> <relative comparison value> <absolute comparison cutoff>
#	OR
# - "float" <float value to compare> (<-- This sets epsilon to a default value)
# - Comparison values should be between float epsilon (~0.00000011921) and 1.0
# - Example:
#	[comparisons]
#	float *.Transform.m_LocalPosition.x 0.0000005
#	float *.Transform.m_LocalPosition.y 0.0000005
#	float *.Transform.m_LocalPosition.z 0.0000005
#	float *.Transform.m_LocalRotation.x 0.00005 0.001
#	float *.Transform.m_LocalRotation.y
#	float *.Transform.m_LocalRotation.z 0.00005 0.001
#	float *.Transform.m_LocalRotation.w
#
# Premerge:
# - Can configure the premerge base file to show blank values (as per legacy mode)
# - Example:
#	[premerge]
#	legacyBlankPremergeBase
